        <b>About Yoga</b>

        <p>
            Yoga improves strength, balance and flexibility.

           Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.
           Yoga helps with back pain relief.
           Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American  College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.
