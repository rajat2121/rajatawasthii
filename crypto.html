        <b>From zero investing knowledge to a somewhat better investing mindset</b>

        <p>
            Growing up in an average Goan "susegad" lifestyle,
            You don't realise the importance of investing.
            Stock markets seem like a scam, a place meant for gamblers? But somehow, playing the "Satta matka" seems
            fine?

            It's not so easy for People to get this mindset unless and untill they make an effort to educate themselves. I'm sure most of us have never come across any teacher telling us about the importance of investing. Now whether the education system is effective or not, we need to ask ourself if we are willing to self educate or just follow the crowd?

        <div> Here are a list of books that are definitely going to help you understand investing.</div>

        <ul>
            <li>rich dad poor dad</li>
            <li>Intelligent investor</li>

            <li>Common stocks and uncommon profits</li>
        </ul>

        <p> I'm not really a big fan of reading but I somehow got myself to read Rich Dad Poor Dad. For the beginners
            who wanna achieve economic prosperity, this book offers insights based on real life experiences. It teaches
            us ideas about applied economics that should have been taught to us in schools or at home. The principles of
            financial literacy- Accounting, Investing and Understanding markets are explained in a way that even a
            layman can fully relate to them. The author emphasizes the importance of sound finances for a better
            meaningful life. </p>



         <p> 
            If you're like most People and don't want to spend hours of your time on     your portfolio, putting your money in passive investments like index funds or mutual funds can be the smart choice. And if you really want
            to take a hands-off approach, an advisor could be right for you.
            Specially if you are a new investor. This is the best and safest way to
            atleast benefit a little out of the markets.

        <b> Mutual funds? SIP?</b>
        <p>
        Here's an explaination in simple words.
        Mutual fund is a collection of stocks maintained by experts and SIP is a systematic investment plan i.e you invest a monthly plan of a particular amount.
        You can check various mutual funds on the net but keep in mind investing in mutual funds is for long duration.
        <br>
        
        Investing money may seem intimidating, especially if youâ€™ve never done it before. However, if you figure out how you want to invest, how much money you should invest, and your risk tolerance, you'll be well positioned to make smart decisions with your money that will serve you well for decades to come.
